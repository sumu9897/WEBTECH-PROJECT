<p><b>Food Donation Management System </b> is a mission to end hunger and no wasting of food to make a hungry-free world.  Food is wasted in many ways so it’s better to give someone else who needs that food.</p>

<ul>
    <ul>
        The application for food donation acts as an interface for users who are looking for a channel to give excess food without wasting it.
</ul>
    <ul>Our main motto is to help needy people.</ul>
    <ul>Large quantities of wholesome edible food are often unused or leftover and discarded from household kitchens and eating establishments.</ul>
</ul>
<p>Less food loss and donating food help to reduce many environmental problems such as pollution, causing global warming, and climate change.</p>
